\begin{exercise}
  \textbf{Let $a : S^n \to S^n$ be the antipodal map, $a(x) = -x$. Show that $a$ is homotopic to the identity map when $n$ is odd. [Try n = 1 first.]}\footnote{Cambridge Algebraic Topology Part ii Example Sheet I.I}
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  Consider a homotopy of $H_1(z, t) = e^{\pi i t}z$. This is the only homotopy as others i.e. $H_2(x, t) = 2xt - 1$ don't lie in the circle. We know $H_1$ lies in the circle as,
  $$ |H_1(z, t)| = |ze^{\pi it}| = |z| = 1 $$
  and also note that $H_1(z, t) \in \C^n$ and $\C^n$ is a `2n-dimensional' space and so this homotopy won't work for odd dimensional systems and so it only maps to the identity map when $n$ is odd.
\end{solution}
